    "## Background\n",
    "Distributed acoustic sensing or DAS, offers exciting new opportunities to eavesdrop on whales by converting existing fiber optic cables into dense listening arrays of strain sensors. It exploits the physics of Raileigh backscattering following the introduction of a interrogating pulse in the fiber, converting time-delays (or phase changes) of the backscattered pulses into strain measurements, analogus to acoustic pressure. DAS is also known as  Distributed Fiber Optic Sensing (DFOS), coherent backscattering, phase Optical Time Domain Reflectometry (phase-OTDR). \n",

    "## About this notebook and the das4whale python package\n",
    "This Jupyter notebook provides an illustration of the current functionalities of the DAS4Whale python package, available on GitHub https://github.com/leabouffaut/DAS4Whales. For now, the package enables basic manipulations and visualizations of DAS data such as:\n",
    "* reading the metadata and loading DAS strain data from a hdf5 file -- functionalities available in the module `das4whale.data_handle`,\n",
    "* high-pass, band-pass and frequency-wavenumber (f-k) filtering -- functionalities available in the module `das4whale.ds`, \n",
    "* spatio-temporal (t-x plot), spatio-spectral (f-x plot) and single channel spectro-temporal (spectrogram) representations -- functionalities available in the module`das4whale.plot`,\n",
    "* single channel sound playbacks -- functionality available in this notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "All functions have built-in documentation accessible through the pythonic `help(das4whale.module.function)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## DAS data\n",
    "If you don't have DAS data, we've got you covered! This notebook is set to automatically download a file from the RAPID: Distributed Acoustic Sensing on the OOI’s Regional Cabled Array experiment in Oregon, which is available in open access. The data we'll look at was recorded using an OptaSense interrogator and is saved in the hdf5 format, standard for most of DAS data collection. To learn more about this experiment see:\n",

    "\n",
    "## A final word\n",
    "Please, report any bugs or issues you may have using this package and notebook either through GitHub or directly by email. This is my first python package and I'm always keen on learning how to make my work more inclusive, accessible and polyvalent. **New contritibutors are Welcome!**\n"
